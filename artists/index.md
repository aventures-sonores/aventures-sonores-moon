We are AVENTURES SONORES, a creative collective group that blends art and technology to make physical and digital (phygital) experiential adventures.

Our Latin American roots and global upbringing inform a strong belief that the interrelation between people, culture, nature, and technology can provide the content, and the means, to create a global, borderless aural community. In this community, participants are no longer a simple spectator, but co-creators of sound, music and sonic wisdom.

The AVENTURES SONORES seeds were planted two years ago. Today, as a growing tree in formation, is an ever-expanding creative, artistic and technological Playground and hub for transdisciplinary creations that seek to generate and foster meaningful creative and listening experiences.
